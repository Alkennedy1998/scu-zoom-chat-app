      <p>
                Enter the Zoom link for your class, create a username,
                and start messaging other people in your class.

                Yes, Zoom does have a build in chat function.
                However, this feature is rarely used for many reasons
                 including the lack on anonymity.
                Something this app provides.
                Did you know teachers are sent a record of ever
                 message sent in the zoom chat after every class?

                You don`&apos`t have to use a zoom link can actually
                 create a chatroom using any string as code
                 which is hashed into a room Id.

                There are a lot of things which could be
                 improved so feel free to contribute on github.
